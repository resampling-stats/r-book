# Association of athletic and IQ scores with $r$


We use random pairings of the athletic and IQ scores to find the
null-world distribution of the correlation coefficients of these scores.

```{r}
# Read the data file containing athletic and IQ scores.
ath_iq_df <- read.csv('data/athletic_iq.csv')

# Turn athletic and IQ scores into vectors.
ath = ath_iq_df$athletic_score
iq = ath_iq_df$iq_score

# Calculate correlation coefficient.
actual_r <- cor(ath, iq)

# Set the number of trials for the null-world simulation.
n_trials <- 10000

# An empty array to store the trial results.
results <- numeric(n_trials)

# Do 10,000 experiments.
for (i in 1:n_trials) {
    # Shuffle the IQ scores so we can pair them against athletic scores.
    shuffled <- sample(iq)
    # Calculate the correlation coefficient.
    fake_r <- cor(ath, shuffled)
    # Keep track of the result in results array.
    results[i] <- fake_r
    # End one trial, go back and repeat until 10000 trials are complete.
}

# Obtain a histogram of the trial results.
hist(results, breaks=25,
    main='Random correlation coefficients',
    xlab='Observed r values from random pairing')

# Determine in how many trials the random r value was greater than
# the observed r value.
k <- sum(results >= actual_r)
# Convert to a proportion.
kk <- k / n_trials
# Print the result.
message('Proportion of random pairings giving r >= observed: ', kk)
