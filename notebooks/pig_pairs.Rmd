# Paired test for pig rations


Use simulation to test for a difference in pig rations, by pairing pigs
and testing the probability of observed differences within the pairs.

```{r}
n_iters <- 10000

# Make array to store results for each trial.
results <- numeric(n_iters)

# Do 10000 trials
for (i in 1:n_iters) {
    # Generate randomly 12 "A" or "B"s.  Each of the 12 values represents
    # one "pairing" where "A" <- ration A "wins," "B" <- ration B "wins.".
    wins <- sample(c('A', 'B'), replace=TRUE, size=12)
    # Count the number of "pairings" where ration A won, put the result in
    # "n_a_wins".
    n_a_wins <- sum(wins == 'A')
    # Keep track of the result in results.
    results[i] <- n_a_wins
    # End the trial, go back and repeat until all 10000 trials are complete.
}
# Determine how often we got 9 or more "wins" for ration A.
high <- sum(results >= 9)
# Determine how often we got 3 or fewer "wins" for ration A.
low <- sum(results <= 3)
# Add the two together
k <- high + low
#  Convert to a proportion
kk <- k / n_iters
# Print the result.
message('Proportion >=9 or <=3: ', kk)
```
