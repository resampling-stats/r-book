# Athletic ability and IQ using rank counts


Continuing with the question: **Is there correlation between two
variables or are they independent?**

This approach differs from the previous notebook in this series, in
looking only at the top 5 permuted I.Q. ranks. Now read on.

In the R code below, we first note that the top 5 athletes had 4 of the
top 5 I.Q. scores. So we constitute the set of 10 IQ rankings vector
`iq_ranks`. We then shuffle `iq_ranks` and select the first 5 I.Q.
rankings (out of 10). We count (`sum`) how many are in the top 5, and
keep track of the result. After repeating 10,000 times using a `for`
loop, we find out how often we select 4 of the top 5.

```{r}
# Number of repeats.
n_trials <- 10000
# The IQ ranks, ready for shuffling.
iq_ranks <- 1:10  # 1 through 10.
# Scorekeeping array.
results <- numeric(n_trials)

for (i in 1:n_trials) {
    # Shuffle the ranks.
    shuffled <- sample(iq_ranks)
    # Take the first 5 ranks.
    top_5 <- shuffled[1:5]
    # Everything up until this point is the same as the code above.
    # Here is the difference.
    # Check whether the selected IQ ranks are in the top 5.
    are_top <- top_5 <= 5
    # Count how many were in the top 5
    n_are_top <- sum(are_top)
    # Keep track of the result of each trial.
    results[i] <- n_are_top
    # End the experiment, go back and repeat.
}

# Determine how many trials produced 4 or more top ranks by chance.
k = sum(results >= 4)
#  Convert to a proportion.
kk = k / n_trials
# Show the result.
kk
```
