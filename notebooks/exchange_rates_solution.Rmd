# Exchange rates and money supply


Solution notebook for exercise on exchange rates and money supply.

```{r}
exchange_df <- read.csv('data/exchange_rates.csv')
exchange_rates <- exchange_df$exchange_rate
money_supply <- exchange_df$money_supply
```

```{r}
# Correlation.
actual_r <- cor(exchange_rates, money_supply)
actual_r
```

```{r}
n_trials <- 10000
results <- numeric(n_trials)

for (i in 1:n_trials) {
    shuffled_rates <- sample(exchange_rates)
    fake_r <- cor(shuffled_rates, money_supply)
    results[i] <- fake_r
}

hist(results, breaks=25,
     main='Distribution of shuffled exchange rates r values',
     xlab='r for shuffled exchange rate')

k <- sum(results >= actual_r)
kk <- k / n_trials

message('p shuffled r >= actual: ', round(kk, 3))
```
